# About
This index provides an initial material to help HW engineers gather the basic knowledge in this field. Our target is to build HW capacity capable of implementing complete, ready to manufacture electronic products for our local market. This list is just a kick start and requires continuous maintenance and enhancements. Currently, it does not cover IC design, FPGA, Antennas or any RF or microwave circuits but may we can consider in the future.
